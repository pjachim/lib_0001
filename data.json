some of the main claims around abortion?", "There are few topics in modern discourse quite as divisive, as fraught with misunderstanding and as rooted in deeply-held conviction as abortion", "Those on the pro-choice side of the spectrum argue that it is a woman\u2019s right to choose whether she carries a pregnancy to term or not", "On the other side, anti-abortion activists insist that from the moment of conception a foetus has an inalienable right to existence", "In recent years, polarisation has increased and the topic has become exceptionally politically partisan, with the personal and political aspects increasingly difficult to separate", "Amid all the passionate argument, it is easy for misunderstandings and fictions to fill the void between opposing ideologies", "Yet if we are to have a reasoned discussion about abortion rights, we have to jettison the persistent falsehoods that cloud the topic", "If we are to choose reason over rhetoric, it is worth addressing some of the more pernicious myths that emerge each time the abortion question is raised", "Of all the myths surrounding abortion, I feel that the assertion that it leads to depression and suicide must rank as the most odious", "It is a perennial favourite of anti-abortion groups", "Anti-abortion campaigners call it PAS \u2013 post-abortion-syndrome, a term coined by Dr Vincent Rue", "Rue is a prolific anti-abortion campaigner who testified before the US Congress in 1981 that he had observed post-traumatic stress syndrome in women who had undergone abortions", "The claim rapidly mutated into the ominous and potent suggestion that abortion leads to suicide and depression", "Yet despite the ubiquity of this claim by anti-abortion advocates, PAS is not recognised by relevant expert bodies", "It does not appear in the DSM-V (the handbook of mental health), and the link between abortion and mental health problems is dismissed by organisations tasked with mental health protection including the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists", "The reason for this dismissive attitude is simple: despite years of research there is no evidence that PAS exists", "The hypothesis that women who undergo an abortion have worse mental health outcomes than those that don\u2019t is at heart a scientific claim and can be tested as such", "One recent study in Denmark charted the psychological health of 365,550 women, including 84,620 who\u2019d had abortions", "They found neither an increase in psychological damage, nor any elevated risk of suicide", "This finding isn\u2019t especially surprising, as previous investigations found that provided a woman was not already depressive then \u201celective

majority of women tolerate abortion without psychiatric sequelae\u201d, a conclusion echoed in systematic reviews", "But despite the science simply not supporting the assertions of the anti-abortion brigade, the myth persists", "In a relatively recent move, some US states now require physicians to warn women seeking an abortion of the dangers to their mental health, in spite of the complete lack of scientific justification for doing so", "In South Dakota, a 2005 state law not only mandated this perversion of informed consent, but also added a reprehensible smattering of emotional manipulation

from more rigorous studies\u201d", "Contrary to the assertions of anti-abortion activists, the majority of women granted an abortion report relief as their primary feeling, not depression", "The research also unveils a subtle but important corollary; whilst women are don\u2019t generally suffer long-term mental health effects related to the abortion, short term guilt and sadness was far more likely if the women came from a background where abortion was viewed negatively or their decisions decried", "Given this is precisely the attitude fostered by anti-abortion activists, there is a dark irony at play when organisations of this ilk increase the suffering of the very women they claim to help", "As if abortion were not already an emotive enough issue, elements of the anti-abortion movement have long postulated that women who elect to have an abortion are at a much increased risk of cancer, particularly of the breast", "This is absolute unbridled nonsense of the highest order - the abortion-breast-cancer conjecture (ABC) was championed by prominent born-again Christian and anti-abortion campaigner Dr Joel Brind in the early 1990s", "This alleged link is not supported by the scientific literature, and the ostensible link between breast cancer and induced abortion is explicitly rejected by the medical community", "But whilst there is scant scientific evidence for the ABC

workshop to look at the evidence in February 2003, and concluded that the hypothesis was devoid of any supporting evidence and was political rather than medical in nature", "After this stinging

adoption of the ABC link as part of its new \u2018women-centred\u2019 strategy", "The suggestion that abortion can damage fertility is understandably terrifying, but based on out-dated understanding of abortion techniques", "Early surgical abortions tended to be performed using a dilation and curettage (D&C) method, with an inherent but small risk of scarring that could potentially lead to complication", "However, this technique is obsolete, replaced with a much safer and effective suction method in the early 1970s", "In the 21st century, the WHO recommend a suction-based technique for surgical abortion, rendering the risk to future fertility negligible", "On top of this, across most of Europe the majority of abortions now take place early in the pregnancy, below 9 weeks", "Abortions at this early stage are medical in nature, using compounds such as mifepristone (RU-486) which induce miscarriage", "There is no evidence that either medical or modern surgical abortion impacts future fertility", "One of the most inflammatory arguments against abortion is rooted in the assertion that the foetus can feel pain, and that termination is therefore a brutal affair", "This is extremely unlikely to be true", "A foetus in the early stages of development lacks the developed nervous system and brain to feel pain or even be aware of their surroundings", "The neuroanatomical apparatus required for pain and sensation is not complete until about 26 weeks into pregnancy", "As the upper limit worldwide for termination is 24 weeks, and the vast majority of pregnancies are terminated well before this (most in the first 9 weeks in the UK), the question of foetal pain is a complete red herring", "This is reflected in the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists\u2019s report on foetal pain, which concludes \u201c", "existing data suggests that cortical processing and therefore foetal perception of pain cannot occur before 24 weeks of gestation\u201d", "Despite its complete lack of veracity, this myth remains a powerful one, and in several US states legislation dictates that doctors can be fined for not warning women that the foetus might experience pain, despite the scientific advice suggesting \u201cproposals to inform women seeking abortions of the potential for pain in foetuses are not supported by evidence", "Legal or clinical mandates for interventions to prevent such pain are scientifically unsound and may expose women to inappropriate interventions, risks, and distress", "Anti-abortion campaigners often operate under the implicit assumption that additional hurdles towards obtaining abortions will decrease the number of abortion performed; this is demonstrably false", "Reducing access to abortion doesn\u2019t quell the demand for abortion, and making abortion illegal simply makes abortion less safe", "Evidence suggests that the abortion rate is approximately equal in countries with and without legal abortion", "A 2012 Lancet study found that regions with restricted abortion access have higher rates than more liberal areas, and restricted regions had a much higher incidence of unsafe abortion", "Worldwide, about 42 million women a year choose to get abortions, and of these about 21", "6 million are unsafe", "The consequences of this are grim, resulting in around 47,000 maternal deaths a year", "This makes it one of the leading causes of maternal mortality (13%), and can lead to serious complications even when survived", "In the developed world where international travel is affordable, abortion restrictions make even less sense", "Ireland, for example, has incredibly restrictive abortion laws, a hangover from the days when it was the last outpost of the Vatican in Europe (a situation I\u2019ve alluded to before)", "But whilst the Irish anti-abortion lobbyists boast of Ireland being abortion-free, this sanctimonious gloat ignores that fact that an average of 12 women a day travel to Britain for abortions, with others procuring abortificants online", "These extra barriers do not dissuade women from seeking terminations, they merely add emotional and financial obstacles to obtaining them", "These are just some of the claims which surface, hydra-like, when abortion is discussed, and this article is by no means comprehensive", "Abortion is an emotive issue,

away from, medical professionals when seeking access to an abortion", "Given that the criminalization of abortion takes personal agency away from women and forces them to carry a child to term or seek illegal and thus dangerous abortion services, protestors have advocated against it by claiming it to be a violation of human rights", "However, that is not the only argument to be made for decriminalizing abortion", "A comparison of Mexico, where abortion has recently been legalized, and El Salvador, which still maintains a total ban on abortion, demonstrates that there is also a notable economic argument to be made for legalizing abortion", "If the case for basic human rights is not a sufficient appeal for countries and states with conservative legislators, then perhaps the understanding that criminalizing abortion is taking a costly toll on the country\u2019s medical system and overall GDP growth might be", "Within Latin America, El Salvador stands out as one of the few countries where abortion is not only illegal\u2014even in cases of rape, incest, and high-risk pregnancy\u2014but where women who have been suspected of having an abortion, or even suspected of wanting an abortion, are actively pursued", "As a result, even women who have suffered a miscarriage become government targets", "If tried and found guilty of aborting their child, many will spend decades in prison suffering from isolation, harsh prison conditions, and further complications of their miscarriage or unsafe abortion", "From 2000 to 2019, 181 such women were prosecuted and

criminalized, women are forced to resort to dangerous alternatives and they also tend to delay getting them", "This inherently increases the risk of the procedure", "Additionally, many women who have suffered a miscarriage avoid going to the hospital, knowing that they may be wrongly accused of having had an abortion", "The consequence, in either case, is higher medical costs when women do ultimately decide to get treated", "In fact, more than half of the budgets that Latin American countries allocate to obstetric care are used for medical treatments following unsafe abortions", "For example, the average total cost of post-abortion care (PAC) in Colombia is US$972", "This is equivalent to 18 percent of Columbia\u2019s annual per capita GDP", "Included in PAC is both curative care to treat post-abortion complications as well as preventative care such as the provision of birth control to prevent future unwanted pregnancies", "PAC costs are significantly lower in countries where abortion is decriminalized because curative care is usually unnecessary", "As an alternative, funding modern contraceptive supplies for one woman for a year would amount to just 7 percent of the average cost of treating a patient who requires PAC", "Intuitively it might not be obvious why increasing access to abortions would drive medical costs down", "However, safe in-clinic abortions are easy, common, and inexpensive procedures", "The current costs associated with abortion care are incurred primarily as a result of seeking unlicensed practitioners to perform an illegal and unsafe abortion usually late in a pregnancy term", "A direct consequence of this is that 10 percent of all maternal mortality in Latin America and the Caribbean is caused by unsafe abortion", "In contrast, unsafe abortion causes less than one percent of maternal mortality in East Asia, a region with less restrictive abortion laws", "In 2007, when Mexico legalized abortion just within the first trimester, the country saw an immediate decrease in hospitalizations", "As Damian Clarke, a health economist at the University of Chile, notably points out, \u201cThere have been very few public health implementations where you see that it cuts morbidity in half with just one law change", "While there is an ethical reason to be made for legalizing abortions, the instant mortality reduction should also alert governments, especially those in developing countries, about a pool of missed savings", "Not only would decriminalizing abortion reduce the country\u2019s healthcare costs and

and strengthen contractions,[8] and Cervidil is used to prepare the cervix for labor by inducing softening and widening of this opening to the uterus", "[9] When used this way, neither medication is considered an abortifacient", "However, the same drugs can be used to induce an abortion, particularly after 12 weeks of pregnancy", "[4][10] Misoprostol (discussed above) is also used to treat peptic

wreak havoc in the body", "Some identified metabolites are menthofuran, piperitenone, piperitone, and menthone", "The active chemical in pennyroyal is pulegone", "Pulegone is a ketone and on the cellular level, ketones can act as enzyme inhibitors", "The carbonyl center of the pulegone structure acts as a strong electrophile, causing active sites on enzymes to bind with pulegone instead of the target protein", "The exocyclic double bond found in pulegone is vital to the activation and binding mechanism of the molecule and causes it to be an effective hepatotoxin", "When ingested, pulegone targets the liver and kidney, among other organs", "Studies have been conducted on rats show that one of the main effects is the inhibition of contractile activity in the myometrium and death by kidney failure", "Also found in the study, long term exposure to pennyroyal increased incidences of urinary bladder tumors", "The exact mechanism of action by which pennyroyal induces menses and abortions in humans is still unknown", "Studies using animal models speculate the source of liver toxicity is due to one of the many constituents the plant contains: pulegone, a monoterpene", "Pulegone is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2 and 2E1) and converted to several toxins", "[35] Both in vitro and in vivo studies have found the pulegone metabolite menthofuran to be an inhibitor of CYP2A6, accounting for a significant degree of pennyroyal's hepatotoxicity", "[36][37][38]", "The exact pathway pulegone undergoes to be converted to menthofuran is unknown, but one study strongly suggested it included allylic oxidation of a methyl group (from CYP450), intramolecular cyclization to form a hemiketal, and subsequent dehydration to form the furan", "[37] Additionally, pulegone and menthofuran may deplete glutathione levels, leaving hepatocytes vulnerable to free radical damage", "There is no known antidote for pennyroyal toxicity", "[28] Case studies involving pennyroyal poisonings have reported the use of gastric lavages and administration of emetics or vomiting inducing agents, or absorbents like activated charcoal", "[4] As glutathione depletion has been

"[86] In 1873, the Comstock Law prohibited any methods of production or publication of information pertaining to the procurement of abortion, the prevention of conception, and the prevention of venereal disease, even to students of medicine", "[87] By 1909, the penalty for violating these laws became a $5000 fine and up to five years imprisonment", "By 1910, nearly every state had anti-abortion laws;[88] these were unevenly enforced at best", "[89]:\u200a80\u2013112", "In contrast, in France social perceptions of abortion started to change", "In the first half of the 19th century, abortion was viewed as the last resort for pregnant but unwed women", "As writers began to write about abortion in terms of family planning for married women, the practice of abortion was reconceptualized as a logical solution to unwanted pregnancies resulting from ineffectual contraceptives", "[90] The formulation of abortion as a form of family planning for married women was made \"thinkable\" because both medical and non-medical practitioners agreed on the relative safety of the procedure", "In New York, surgical abortion in 1800s carried a death rate of 30% regardless of hospital setting, and the AMA launched an anti-abortion campaign that resulted in abortion becoming the exclusive domain of doctors", "[91] A paper published in 1870 on the abortion services to be found in Syracuse, New York, concluded that the method most often practiced there during this time was to flush inside of the uterus with injected water", "The article's author, Ely Van de Warkle, claimed this procedure was affordable even to a maid, as a man in town offered it for $10 on an installment plan", "[92] Other prices which 19th-century abortion providers are reported to have charged were much more steep", "In Britain, it could cost from 10 to 50 guineas, or 5% of the yearly income of a lower middle class household", "From 1870 there was a steady decline in fertility in England, linked by some commentators not to a rise in the use of artificial contraception but to more traditional methods such as withdrawal and abstinence", "This was linked to changes in the perception of the relative costs of childrearing", "Of course, women did find themselves with unwanted pregnancies", "Abortifacients were discreetly advertised and there was a considerable body of folklore about methods of inducing miscarriages", "Amongst working-class women violent purgatives were popular, pennyroyal, aloes and turpentine were all used", "Other methods to induce miscarriage were very hot baths and gin, extreme exertion, a controlled fall down a flight of stairs, or veterinary medicines", "So-called 'backstreet' abortionists were fairly common, although their bloody efforts could be fatal", "Estimates of the number of illegal abortions performed in England varied widely: by one estimate, 100,000 women made efforts to procure a miscarriage in 1914, usually by drugs", "[citation needed]", "A rash of unexplained miscarriages in Sheffield, England were attributed to lead poisoning caused by the metal pipes which fed the city's water supply", "Soon, women began using diachylon, a substance with a high concentration of lead, as an abortifacient", "In 1898, a woman confessed to having used diachylon to induce a miscarriage", "[6] The use of diachylon became prevalent in the English Midlands up until World War I", "Criminal investigation of an abortionist in Calgary, Alberta in 1894 revealed through chemical analysis that the concoction he had supplied to a man seeking an abortifacient contained Spanish fly", "Evelyn Fisher wrote of how women living in a mining town in Wales during the 1920s used candles intended for Roman Catholic ceremonies to dilate the cervix in an effort to self-induce abortion", "[6] Similarly, the use of candles and other objects, such as glass rods, penholders, curling irons, spoons, sticks, knives, and catheters was reported during the 19th century in the United States", "[94] Women of Jewish descent in Lower East Side, Manhattan are said to have carried the ancient Indian practice of sitting over a pot of steam into the early 20th century", "[11] Some commentators maintained that abortion remained a dangerous procedure into the early 20th century, more dangerous than childbirth until about 1930", "[95] But others have said that in the 19th century early abortions under the hygienic conditions in which midwives usually worked were relatively safe", "[96]:\u200a25\u200a[97]:\u200a4\u200a[98]:\u200a59", "[99]:\u200a223\u200a[100][101][102] In addition, some authors have written that, despite improved medical procedures, the period from the 1930s until legalization also saw more zealous enforcement of anti-abortion laws, and concomitantly an increasing control of abortion providers by organized crime", "[89][103][104][105][106]", "Despite bans enacted on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, access to abortion continued, as the disguised advertisement of abortion services, abortion-inducing devices, and abortifacient medicines in the Victorian era would seem to suggest", "[107] Apparent print ads of this nature were found in the United States,[108] the United Kingdom,[6] and Canada", "[109] A British Medical Journal writer who replied to newspaper ads peddling relief to women who were \"temporarily indisposed\" in 1868 found that over half of them were in fact promoting abortion", "A few examples of surreptitiously marketed abortifacients include \"Farrer's Catholic Pills\", \"Hardy's Woman's Friend\", \"Dr", "Peter's French Renovating Pills\", \"Lydia Pinkham's Vegetable Compound\",[110] and \"Madame Drunette's Lunar Pills\"", "[6] Patent medicines which claimed to treat \"female complaints\" often contained such ingredients as pennyroyal, tansy, and savin", "Abortifacient products were sold under the promise of \"restor[ing] female regularity\" and \"removing from the system every impurity\"", "[110] In the vernacular of such advertising, \"irregularity\", \"obstruction\", \"menstrual suppression\", and \"delayed period\" were understood to be euphemistic references to the state of pregnancy", "As such, some abortifacients were marketed as menstrual regulatives", "Beecham's Pills were marketed primarily as a laxative from 1842", "They were invented by Thomas Beecham from St Helens, Lancashire, England", "The pills were a combination of aloe, ginger, and soap, with some other more minor ingredients", "The popularity of the pills produced a wide range of testimonials that were used in advertising", "The poet William Topaz McGonagall wrote a poem advertising the pills, giving his recommendation in verse", "[111] Beecham's expenditure on advertising went from \u00a322,000 to \u00a395,000 in the 1880s", "[112] An 1897 advertisement in the Christian Herald edition for Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee said: \"Worth a guinea a box", "Beecham's Pills for all bilious and nervous disorders such as Sick Headache, Constipation, Weak Stomach, Impaired Digestion, Disordered Liver and Female Ailments", "The sale is now 6 million boxes per annum", "\" The text was printed alongside a picture of a young woman at a beach and was captioned \"What are the wild waves saying? Try Beecham's Pills", "Gordon's Pearls of Health\", produced by a drug company in Montreal, \"cure[d] all suppressions and irregularities\" if \"used monthly\"", "[114] However, a few ads explicitly warned against the use of their product by women who were expecting, or listed miscarriage as its inevitable side effect", "The copy for \"Dr", "Peter's French Renovating Pills\" advised, \"", "pregnant females should not use them, as they invariably produce a miscarriage", "\", and both \"Dr", "Monroe's French Periodical Pills\" and \"Dr", "Melveau's Portuguese Female Pills\" were \"sure to produce a miscarriage\"", "Karn, a man from Toronto, in 1901 cautioned women who thought themselves pregnant not to use the pills he advertised as \"Friar's French Female Regulator\" because they would \"speedily restore menstrual secretions", "\"[114] Historian Ann Hibner Koblitz comments that \"Nineteenth-century customers would have understood this 'warning' exactly as the sellers intended: as an advertisement for an abortifacient preparation", "In the mid 1930s abortifacients drugs were marketed in the United States to women by various companies under various names such as Molex Pills and Cote Pills", "Since birth control devices and abortifacients were illegal to market and sell at the time, they were offered to women who were \"delayed\"", "The recommended dosage constituted seven grains of ergotin a day", "These pills generally contained ingredients such as ergotin, aloes, Black Hellebore", "The efficacy and safety of these pills are unknown", "In 1940 the FTC[116] deemed them unsafe and ineffective and demanded that these companies cease and desist selling these products", "A well-known example of a Victorian-era abortionist was Madame Restell, or Ann Lohman, who over a forty-year period illicitly provided both surgical abortion and abortifacient pills in the northern United States", "She began her business in New York during the 1830s, and, by the 1840s, had expanded to include franchises in Boston and Philadelphia", "It is estimated that by 1870 her annual expenditure on advertising alone was $60,000", "[6] Because of her reputation, Restellism became a synonym for abortion", "One ad for Restell's medical services, printed in the New York Sun, promised that she could offer the \"strictest confidence on complaints incidental to the female frame\" and that her \"experience and knowledge in the treatment of cases of female irregularity, [was] such as to require but a few days to effect a perfect cure\"", "[118] Another, addressed to married women, asked the question, \"Is it desirable, then, for parents to increase their families, regardless of consequences to themselves, or the well-being of their offspring, when a simple, easy, healthy, and certain remedy is within our control?\"[119] Advertisements for the \"Female Monthly Regulating Pills\" she also sold vowed to resolve \"all cases of suppression, irregularity, or stoppage of the menses, however obdurate\"", "[118] Madame Restell was an object of criticism in both the respectable and penny presses", "She was first arrested in 1841, but, it was her final arrest by Anthony Comstock which led to her suicide on the day of her trial April 1, 1878", "Such advertising aroused criticisms of quackery and immorality", "The safety of many nostrums was suspect and the efficacy of others non-existent", "[94] Horace Greeley, in a New York Herald editorial written in 1871, denounced abortion and its promotion as the \"infamous and unfortunately common crime\u2013 so common that it affords a lucrative support to a regular guild of professional murderers, so safe that its perpetrators advertise their calling in the newspapers\"", "[108] Although the paper in which Greeley wrote accepted such advertisements, others, such as the New York Tribune, refused to print them", "[108] Elizabeth Blackwell, the first woman to obtain a Doctor of Medicine in the United States, also lamented how such ads led to the contemporary synonymity of \"female physician\" with \"abortionist\"", "Abortifacient advertising was highly effective in the United States, though apparently less so across the Atlantic", "Contemporary estimates of mid-19th century abortion rates in the United States suggest between 20% and 25% of all pregnancies in the United States during that era ended in abortion", "[120] This era also saw a marked shift in those who were obtaining abortions", "Before the start of the 19th century, most abortions were sought by unmarried women who had become pregnant out of wedlock", "But, out of 54 abortion cases published in American medical journals between 1839 and 1880, over half were sought by married women, and of the married women well over 60 percent already had at least one child", "[121] In the post-Civil War era, much of the blame was placed on the burgeoning women's rights movement", "[citation needed]", "Many feminists of the era were opposed to abortion", "[122][123] In The Revolution, operated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B", "Anthony, an anonymous contributor signing \"A\" wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed", "Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, \"be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains", "] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed", "It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime", "\"[123][124][125][126] To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men", "[127] Even the \"free love\" wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women", "[128] Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women's right to abstinence", "Socialist feminists tended to be more sympathetic to the need for abortion options for the poor, and indeed socialist feminist doctors, such as Marie Equi, Madeleine Pelletier, and William J", "Robinson, themselves performed low-cost or free abortions for poor women", "[129][130][131]", "The movement to liberalize abortion laws emerged in the 1920s and '30s as part of rising feminist activism that had already resulted in victories in the area of birth control", "Campaigners including Marie Stopes in England and Margaret Sanger in the US had succeeded in bringing the issue into the open, and birth control clinics were established which offered family planning advice and contraceptive methods to women in need", "In 1929, the Infant Life Preservation Act was passed in Britain, which amended the law (Offences against the Person Act 1861) so that an abortion carried out in good faith, for the sole purpose of preserving the life of the mother, would not be an offence", "Stella Browne was a leading birth control campaigner, who increasingly began to venture into the more contentious issue of abortion in the 1930s", "Browne's beliefs were heavily influenced by the work of Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists", "[133] She came to strongly believe that working women should have the choice to become pregnant and to terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy", "[134] In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women who wanted to know about it", "This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not", "In the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around England, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women's health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics", "[133] These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands", "She became increasingly interested in her view of the woman's right to terminate their pregnancies, and in 1929 she brought forward her lecture \"The Right to Abortion\" in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London", "[133] In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an abortion", "[133] She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning", "Another prominent feminist to influence abortion law was Emily Stowe", "In the 19th century she was one of the first doctors to be tried for attempting an abortion procedure in Canada", "Other prominent feminists, including Frida Laski, Dora Russell, Joan Malleson and Janet Chance began to champion this cause \u2013 the cause broke dramatically into the mainstream in July 1932 when the British Medical Association council formed a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion", "[133] On 17 February 1936, Janet Chance, Alice Jenkins and Joan Malleson established the Abortion Law Reform Association as the first advocacy organisation for abortion liberalization", "The association promoted access to abortion in the United Kingdom and campaigned for the elimination of legal obstacles", "[137] In its first year ALRA recruited 35 members, and by 1939 had almost 400 members", "The ALRA was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers", "They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA's Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr", "Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA", "[137] This case gained a lot of publicity", "However, once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public", "In 1938, Joan Malleson precipitated one of the most influential cases in British abortion law when she referred a pregnant fourteen-year-old rape victim to gynaecologist Aleck Bourne", "He performed an abortion, then illegal, and was put on trial on charges of procuring abortion", "Bourne was eventually acquitted in Rex v", "Bourne as his actions were \"an example of disinterested conduct in consonance with the highest traditions of the profession\"", "[138] This court case set a precedent that doctors could not be prosecuted for performing an abortion in cases where pregnancy would probably cause \"mental and physical wreck\"", "Finally, the Birkett Committee, established in 1937 by the British government \"to inquire into the prevalence of abortion, and the law relating thereto\", recommended a change to abortion laws two years later", "The intervention of World War II meant that all plans were shelved", "Another prominent figure in the reform of abortion laws was Dr", "Morgentaler", "Although born in Poland he made a name for himself in Canada, opening multiple illegal abortion clinics in Toronto, Ontario", "Prior to 1969, abortion was considered a crime for which the maximum punishment was life imprisonment for the doctor performing the abortion and two years imprisonment for the woman receiving the abortion", "Abortion remained illegal until 1988, when the Supreme Court of Canada overruled the criminal punishments for abortion", "[141] Abortion remains a hotly debated topic", "As of 2008 in Canada only 1-2% of abortions were pharmaceutically induced", "[142] After much controversy, starting in 2017 abortion pills could be used legally in Canada", "The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the first government to legalize abortion and make it available on request, often for no cost", "[144][145] The Soviet government hoped to provide access to abortion in a safe environment performed by a trained doctor instead of babki", "[146] While this campaign was extremely effective in the urban areas (as much as 75% of abortions in Moscow were performed in hospitals by 1925), it had much less effect on rural regions where there was neither access to doctors, transportation, or both and where women relied on traditional medicine", "[147] In the countryside in particular, women continued to see babki, midwives, hairdressers, nurses, and others for the procedure after abortion was legalized in the Soviet Union", "From 1936 until 1955 the Soviet Union made abortion illegal (except for medically recommended cases) again, stemming largely from Joseph Stalin's worries about population growth", "Stalin wanted to encourage population growth, as well as place a stronger emphasis on the importance of the family unit to communism", "During the Spanish Civil War, on 25 December 1936, in Catalonia, free abortion was legalized during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy with a decree signed by Josep Tarradellas, First Minister of the Government of Catalonia, and published on 9 January 1937 (Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya, n\u00fam", "[150][151][152]", "In Britain, the Abortion Law Reform Association continued its campaigning after the War, and this, combined with broad social changes brought the issue of abortion back into the political arena in the 1960s", "President of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists John Peel chaired the committee advising the British Government on what became the 1967 Abortion Act", "On the grounds of reducing the amount of disease and death associated with illegal abortion, the Abortion Act allowed for legal abortion on a number of grounds, including to prevent grave permanent injury to the woman's physical or mental health, to avoid injury to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing child(ren) if the pregnancy was still under 28 weeks, or if the child was likely to be severely physically or mentally handicapped", "The free provision of abortions was provided through the National Health Service", "In America an abortion reform movement emerged in the 1960s", "In 1963, the Society for Humane Abortion was formed, providing women with information on how to obtain and perform abortions", "[154] In 1964 Gerri Santoro of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the abortion rights movement", "Some women's rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere", "As an example, in Chicago, a group known as \"Jane\" operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s", "Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find \"Jane\"", "In the late 1960s, a number of organizations were formed to mobilize opinion both against and for the legalization of abortion", "The forerunner of the NARAL Pro-Choice America was formed in 1969 to oppose restrictions on abortion and expand access to abortion", "[156] In late 1973 NARAL became the National Abortion Rights Action League", "The American Medical Association, the American Bar Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the California Medical Association, the California Bar Association, and numerous other groups announced support behind new laws that would protect doctors from criminal prosecution if they performed abortions under rigid hospital controls", "In 1967, Colorado became the first state to decriminalize a doctor performing an abortion in cases of rape, incest, or in which pregnancy would lead to permanent physical disability of the woman", "A bipartisan majority in the California legislature supported a new law introduced by Democratic state senator Anthony Beilenson, the \"Therapeutic Abortion Act\"", "Catholic clergy were strongly opposed but Catholic lay people were divided and non-Catholics strongly supported the proposal", "Governor Ronald Reagan consulted with his father-in-law, a prominent surgeon who supported the law", "He also consulted with James Cardinal McIntyre, the Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles", "The archbishop strongly opposed any legalization of abortion and he convinced Reagan to announce he would veto the proposed law since the draft allowed abortions in the case of birth defects", "The legislature dropped that provision and Reagan signed the law, which decriminalized abortions when done to protect the health of the mother", "[157][158][159]  The expectation was that abortions would not become more numerous but would become much safer under hospital conditions", "In 1968 the first full year under the new law there were 5,018 abortions in California", "The numbers grew exponentially and stabilized at about 100,000 annually by the 1970s", "It was abortion-on-demand, as 99", "2% of California women who applied for an abortion were granted one", "One out of every three pregnancies was ended by illegal abortion", "The key factor was the sudden emergence of a woman's movement that introduced a very new idea\u2014women had a basic right to control their bodies and could choose to have an abortion or not", "Reagan by 1980 found his support among anti-abortion religious groups and said he was too new as governor to make a wise decision", "In 1970, Hawaii became the first state to legalize abortions on the request of the woman,[161] and New York repealed its 1830 law and allowed abortions up to the 24th week of pregnancy", "Similar laws were soon passed in Alaska and Washington", "A law in Washington, D", ", which allowed abortion to protect the life or health of the woman, was challenged in the Supreme Court in 1971 in United States v", "The court upheld the law, deeming that \"health\" meant \"psychological and physical well-being\", essentially allowing abortion in Washington, DC", "By the end of 1972, 13 states had a law similar to that of Colorado, while Mississippi allowed abortion in cases of rape or incest only and Alabama and Massachusetts allowed abortions only in cases where the woman's physical health was endangered", "The landmark judicial ruling of the Supreme Court in Roe v", "Wade ruled that a Texas statute forbidding abortion except when necessary to save the life of the mother was unconstitutional", "The immediate result was that all state laws to the contrary were null", "The Court arrived at its decision by concluding that the issue of abortion and abortion rights falls under the right to privacy", "The Court held that a right to privacy existed and included the right to have an abortion", "The court found that a mother had a right to abortion until viability, a point to be determined by the abortion doctor", "After viability a woman can obtain an abortion for health reasons, which the Court defined broadly to include psychological well-being", "From the 1970s, and the spread of second-wave feminism, abortion and reproductive rights became unifying issues among various women's rights groups in Canada, the United States, the Netherlands, Britain, Norway, France, Germany, and

which is used today was initially designed in France in 1723, but was not applied specifically to a gynecological purpose until 1842", "[164] Dilation and curettage has been practiced since the late 19th century", "The 20th century saw improvements in abortion technology, increasing its safety, and reducing its side-effects", "Vacuum devices, first described by the Scottish obstetrician James Young Simpson in the 19th century, allowed for the development of suction-aspiration abortion", "[164] The process was improved by the Russian doctor S", "Bykov in 1927, where the method was used during its period of liberal abortion laws from 1920 to 1936", "The technology was also used in China and Japan before being introduced to Britain and the United States in the 1960s", "[164] The invention of the Karman cannula, a flexible plastic cannula which replaced earlier metal models in the 1970s, reduced the occurrence of perforation and made suction-aspiration methods possible under local anesthesia", "In 1971, Lorraine Rothman and Carol Downer, founding members of the feminist self-help movement, invented the Del-Em, a safe, cheap suction device that made it possible for people with minimal training to perform early abortions called menstrual extraction", "[164] During the mid-1990s in the United States the medical community showed renewed interest in manual vacuum aspiration as a method of early surgical abortion", "This resurgence is due to technological advances that permit early pregnancy detection (as soon as a week after conception) and a growing popular demand for safe, effective early abortion options, both surgical and medical", "An innovator in the development of early surgical abortion services is Jerry Edwards, a physician, who developed a protocol in which women are offered an abortion using a handheld vacuum syringe as soon as a positive pregnancy test is received", "This protocol also allows the early detection of an ectopic pregnancy", "Intact dilation and extraction was developed by Dr", "James McMahon in 1983", "It resembles a procedure used in the 19th century to save a woman's life in cases of obstructed labor, in which the fetal skull was first punctured with a perforator, then crushed and extracted with a forceps-like instrument, known as a cranioclast", "In 1980, researchers at Roussel Uclaf in France developed mifepristone, a chemical compound which works as an abortifacient by blocking hormone action", "It was first marketed in France under the trade name Mifegyne in 1988", "[167] In July 2015 Canada approved mifepristone in combination with misoprostol (under the name Mifegymiso)", "At various times abortion has been banned or restricted in countries around the world", "Multiple scholars have noticed that in many cases, this has caused women to seek dangerous, illegal abortions underground or inspired trips abroad for \"reproductive tourism\"", "[169][170][171] Half of the world's current deaths due to unsafe abortions occur in Asia", "Other authors have written that illegality has not always meant that abortions were unsafe", "during the 19th century, early abortions under the

government made abortion illegal, with punishments for those who received or performed illegal abortions written into the law", "[173] These restrictions were seen as the government's way of emphasizing the importance of population growth", "As the decade went on, the laws were relaxed with the intent of reducing the number of deaths and lifelong injuries women sustained due to illegal abortions, as well as serving as a form of population control when used in conjunction with birth control", "[173] In the early 1980s, the state implemented a form of family planning which used abortion as a \"back-up method\"; and in 2005, there has been legislation trying to curb sex-selective abortion", "[173] As of 2009, although China had the highest number of abortions in the world, Russia had the highest rate in the world", "India enforced the Indian Penal Code from 1860 to 1971, criminalizing abortion and punishing both the practitioners and the women who sought out the

acceptance of abortion", "[169][175] It is estimated that two-thirds of Japanese women have an abortion by age forty, partially due to former government restrictions on contraceptive pills on 'public hygiene grounds'", "The Eugenics Protection Law of 1948 made abortion on demand legal up to twenty-two weeks' gestation so long as the woman's health was endangered; in 1949, this law was extended to consider the risk the child's birth would place on a woman's economic welfare", "[169][175] Originally, each case would have to be approved by a local eugenics council, but this was removed from the law in 1952, making the decision a private one between a woman and her physician", "In 1964, the creation of the conservative right-wing nationalist political lobbying group called Seicho-no-Ie brought about a strong opposition to the abortion laws", "[169] This campaign reached its peak strength in the early 1980s, but ultimately failed in 1983", "In 1957, Romania legalized abortion, but in 1966, after a decline in the national birthrate, Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu approved Decree 770, which criminalized abortion and encouraged childbirth", "As a result of this decree, women in want of abortion turned to illegal procedures that caused the deaths of over 9,000 women and left unwanted children abandoned in orphanages", "Abortion remained illegal until 1989, when the decree was overturned", "There was intense public debate throughout the 1980s and 1990s over legal abortion reform", "[169] These debates portrayed abortion as un-Buddhist and anti-religious; abortion opponents ultimately labeled it as a form of Western corruption that was inherently anti-Thai and threatened the integrity of the nation", "[169] Despite this, in 2006, abortions became legal in cases of rape or foetal impairment", "[169] Mental health also became a factor in determining the legality of an abortion procedure", "[169] The strict regulations involved in qualifying for a legal abortion,

obstetrics in Classical Antiquity (here meaning the ancient Greco-Roman world) were studied by the physicians of ancient Greece and Rome", "Their ideas and practices during this time endured in Western medicine for centuries and many themes are seen in modern women's health", "Classical Gynecology and obstetrics were originally studied and taught mainly by midwives in the ancient world, but eventually scholarly physicians of both sexes became involved as well", "Obstetrics is traditionally defined as the surgical specialty dealing with the care of a woman and her offspring during pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium (recovery)", "Gynecology involves the medical practices dealing with the health of women's reproductive organs (vagina, uterus, ovaries) and their breasts", "Midwifery and obstetrics are distinctly different but overlap in medical practice that focuses on pregnancy and labor", "Midwifery emphasizes the normality of pregnancy along with the reproductive process", "Classical Antiquity saw the beginning of attempts to classify various areas of medical research, and the terms gynecology and obstetrics came into use", "The Hippocratic Corpus, a large collection of treatises attributed to Hippocrates, features a number of gynecological treatises, which date to the classical period", "During the era of Classical Antiquity, women practiced as doctors, but they were by far in the minority and typically confined to only gynecology and obstetrics", "Aristotle was an important influence on later medical writers in Greece and eventually Europe", "Similar to the writers of the Hippocratic Corpus, Aristotle concluded that women's physiology was fundamentally different from that of men primarily because women were physically weaker, and therefore more prone to symptoms caused in some way by weakness, such as the theory of humourism", "This belief claimed that both men and women had several \"humours\" regulating their physical health, and that women had a \"cooler\" humour", "[1] The Hippocratic Corpus writers indicated that men were more rational than women, and that women's physiology made them susceptible to problems that would cause symptoms of irrationality", "[1] Continuing with this assumption that men were more rational, men dominated the profession of physicians, an occupation requiring rational research, and for which they believed women were not suited", "This did not stop women from becoming physicians, however; Agnodice, who in 300 BC left Athens and went to Alexandria to study medicine and midwifery in Hellenistic Alexandria under Hierophilus", "She returned to Athens and became a popular gynecologist; it was said that she disguised herself as a man in order to practice medicine on men", "Agnodice became so popular among her female patients that her male colleagues charged her with seducing her patients", "In court, she revealed her sex and was exonerated", "[2] Philista was a popular professor of medicine who delivered lectures from behind a curtain, to prevent her beauty from distracting her students", "[3] In ancient Greece, there was also an opportunity for midwives to receive some further medical training, to become a doctor-midwife, called in the Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine eras an iatromea (\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03af\u03b1)", "[4]

been numerous", "The Law Code of Justinian presumed women doctors to be primarily obstetricians", "The first medical text known to be written by a woman is by Metrodora, Concerning the Feminine Diseases of the Womb, a work in 63 chapters that was part of a series of at least two works that she authored", "The earliest copy dates from between the 2nd century and the 4th century AD", "It is important to remember that during Classical Antiquity, anyone could be trained as a doctor at one of the many medical schools/hospitals, the Asclepeieon", "Training involved mainly practical applications as well as forming an apprenticeship to other doctors", "During the Hellenistic era, the Library of Alexandria also served as a medical school, where research and training would take place on the body of the diseased", "It also appears that the children, male or female, of famous doctors, would also follow the medical profession, continuing the family tradition", "For example,  Pantheia, who was the wife of a physician, became one herself, a pattern also seen in the careers of Aurelia Alexandria Zosime and Auguste", "Auguste received recognition as a chief doctor of her city, a title her husband also received", "Metilia Donata was prominent enough to commission a large public building in Lyon", "Anthiochis of Tlos, the daughter of a prominent physician, Diodotus, was recognized by the council of Tlos for her work as a doctor and had a statue of herself erected", "She was also a widely discussed expert cited by Galen and others", "Aspasia is quoted extensively by Aetius on gynecology", "This Greco-Roman approach differs greatly from other ancient civilizations, where women's role as medical specialists concerning gynecology and obstetrics was apparently unquestioned", "Medical schools attached to temples in ancient Egypt were numerous, including well-known medical schools for women at Heliopolis and Sais, where women are also believed to have been the professors", "Hippocrates was the first to use the term cancer to describe the hard lesions occasionally found in women's breasts", "He reasoned that the lesions were caused by problems with the woman's uterus and menstrual cycle", "Symptoms of these lesions were believed to be pain, appetite loss, bitter taste, and confusion", "[8] Hippocrates urged against surgery as a treatment for breast cancer because he considered it harmful and found that the prognosis was much better for women who did not have the lesions removed or treated", "In his later work Diseases of Women, Hippocrates furthers the list of late-stage cancer symptoms by including deliria, dehydration, dry nipples, loss of sense of smell, and shallow breathing", "Galen considered breast cancer to be a result of excess black bile in the body, referencing to Hippocrates' theory of the humoral theory of diseases", "He hypothesized that a women's menstrual period was a method of removing black bile from the body", "This idea fit his observation that it more common for women in menopause and pre-menopause to develop breast lesions", "Unlike Hippocrates, Galen encouraged surgical removal of tumors and even prescribed special diets and purgation to rid the body of excess black bile", "Aristotle formulated early tests for infertility by placing scented cloth in a woman's vagina for an extended amount of time and determining whether the aroma came out of the mouth or if the eyes or saliva was colored", "This test determined whether or not the woman's semen passes were open or closed", "[10] Hippocrates formed a similar test by observing whether a scent would pass through a woman's body out of her mouth when the smell was produced between her legs while she was wrapped in a blanket", "Hippocrates further tested for infertility by putting red stone in a woman's eyes and determining if it penetrated through", "During antiquity, there was no profession equal to that of our modern day nurse", "No ancient medical sources discuss any sort of trained nursing personnel assisting doctors", "However, many texts mention the use of slaves or members of a doctor's family as assistants", "[11] The closest similarity to that of a nurse during antiquity was a midwife", "Midwifery flourished in ancient civilizations, including Egypt, Byzantium, Mesopotamia, and the Mediterranean empires of Greece and Rome", "There were doctors within the Greco-Roman world who wrote favourably of midwifery", "Herophilus wrote a manual for midwives, which advanced their status", "This was followed by the work of the Greek Soranus of Ephesus (98-138 AD), who was widely translated into Latin,[12] and Galen", "Soranus was an important gynecologist and is credited with four books describing the female

that midwives filled in society", "Women practiced birth control in antiquity mainly through their knowledge of plants and herbs", "Their knowledge was transmitted by herders who observed sterility of their livestock when exposed to certain plants", "Knowledge of birth control was also transmitted by word of mouth, mainly originating from knowledgeable midwives", "Midwives knew how to identify necessary plants, how to administer them, and most importantly, when to administer them in relation to the last menstruation or coitus", "A very popular plant used for birth control by the Greeks was Silphium", "It is a giant fennel-like herb which was filled with a pungent sap and offered a rich flavor", "The plant was so widely used that it appeared on a Cyrenian coin as a woman touched the plant with one hand and pointed to her genitals with the other", "[15] The demand for the plant was so great that by the fourth century, it had gone extinct", "It is believed that the heart shape originated from the seed of this plant as they are the same shape and the plant was associated with love, romance, and sexuality", "Although Silphium was most popular, there were many other plants and herbs used", "The seeds of Queen Anne's Lace (a wild carrot) were cut up or chewed to release ingredients that inhibited fetal and ovarian growth", "These seeds are still commonly used in India", "[15] Another plant used was pennyroyal, an abortifacient", "[17] Although toxic, pennyroyal was consumed in small dosages in tea because it contained the abortive substance pulegone", "[18] A medical document dating back to 1500 BC in Egypt includes a list of substances used as birth control", "One substance involved making a paste from acacia gum, dates, fiber, honey, and other unidentified plants to create a sort of spermicide", "[15] Early physicians Galen and Dioscorides believed that women would consume willow and pomegranate kernels to prevent pregnancy as well", "Soranus of Ephesus advocated for the application of ointments made of old olive oil, honey, cedar resin, and white lead on the cervix in order block the opening to the uterus", "However, Soranus believed birth control was most effective when oral contraceptives were combined with certain procedures", "Soranus recommended that women should avoid having intercourse during their fertile period in their cycle, as well as avoid deep penetration", "[18] After intercourse, women were urged to squat, sneeze, and cleanse the vagina before drinking something cold", "If these combined practices failed in the prevention of pregnancy, recipes including small amounts of Cyrenaic juice, diluted wine, leukoion, and white pepper were prescribed to induce abortion", "Abortions were uncommon, but in their few occurrences, were performed by the mother herself", "The results for both mother and child were often fatal as most abortions were performed by plunging a dagger into the woman's vagina", "[15] Because of this procedure, it was most common to carry a baby full term before performing the abortion", "According to the Hippocratic Corpus, there were oral alternatives used to induce abortion such as chaste, tree, copper, and Ferula species", "[16] Plato explored the control that midwives perhaps had during this process:", "And furthermore, the midwives, by means of drugs [149d] and incantations, are able to arouse the pangs of labor and, if they wish, to make them milder, and to cause those to bear who have difficulty in bearing; and they cause miscarriages if they think them desirable", "There were many theories used to determine whether a woman was pregnant during antiquity", "A popular method involved examining the vessels of her breasts", "A second method involved sitting a woman on a beer and date mash covered floor and using a proportionality equation according to the number of times she vomits", "Another method included inserting an onion into a woman's vagina and determining whether or not it could be smelled from her breath", "[15] Although there is little evidence as to whether or not any of these methods were confirmed medical procedures or if they were just folklore", "Hospitals did not exist during antiquity so delivery took place in the home of the expectant mother with a midwife and other assistants to the midwife", "Religion played a major role during labor and delivery", "Women called upon Artemis, a goddess with the ability to bring new life into the world as well as the ability to take it away", "Though she remained a virgin herself, it was said that she witnessed the pain of her mother during the birth of her brother, Apollo, and immediately assumed the position of midwife", "If a woman died during childbirth, her clothes were taken to the temple of Artemis due to the fact the woman's death was attributed to her", "[19] If the birth was successful, the mother would make an offering of thanks by sacrificing some of her clothes to the goddess as well", "Herbs and other plants were used heavily in the delivery process, a practice also linked to religious belief", "For example, a drink sprinkled with powdered sow\u2019s dung was given to relieve labor pain, and fumigation with the fat from a hyena was thought to produce immediate delivery", "[21] Most of these practices had little to no medical efficacy, but they did probably provide some placebo effect", "Despite the attempt to use science in advancing medical knowledge, the experimentation and teachings of the Hippocratic Corpus were not necessarily more effective than the traditional customs of midwifery", "For example, the Hippocratic writers believed that the womb could move out of place and cause health problems, and the prescribed treatment was to coax the displaced womb back into place using sweet-smelling herbs", "Soranus described three main stages of pregnancy: conception, which regarded keeping the male seed within the womb; pica, which occurred 40 days into pregnancy and included symptoms of nausea and cravings for extraordinary foods", "During this phase women were also instructed to exercise and sleep more to build up strength as preparation for the labor process", "The final stage of pregnancy was described as the labor and the process of delivery", "In preparation for labor, the woman was advised to bathe in wine and sweet-water baths to calm her mind before delivery", "Her belly was then rubbed with oils to decrease the appearance of stretch marks, and her genitals were anointed with herbs and injected with softeners such as goose fat", "The role of the midwife was very important during the process of childbirth and Soranus described her role in great detail", "For example, the midwife was to have certain tools to ensure a safe delivery, including: clean olive oil, sea sponges, pieces of wool bandages to cradle the infant, a pillow, strong smelling herbs in case of fainting, and a birthing stool", "[21] A birthing stool is a chair from which the seat has been removed", "The midwife would ready her supplies as labor began", "During the labor process, the mother would lie on her back on a hard, low bed with support under her hips", "Her thighs were parted with her feet drawn up", "Gentle massage was implemented to ease labor pains as cloths soaked in warm olive oil were laid over her stomach and genital area", "Against the woman's sides were placed hot compresses in the form of warm oil-filled bladders", "During the actual birth, the mother would be moved to the birthing stool, where she was seated or would squat on two large bricks with a midwife in front of her and female aides standing at her sides", "In a normal headfirst delivery, the cervical opening was stretched slightly, and the rest of the body was pulled out", "Soranus instructed the midwife to wrap her hands in pieces of cloth or thin papyrus so that the slippery newborn did not slide out of her grasp", "A widely cited myth claims that the word \u201ccaesarian\u201d possibly derives from the ancient Roman ruler Julius Caesar, because it was believed that Caesar was delivered through this procedure", "[23] The oldest reference to this myth is a passage from the Suda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia", "The myth is a misinterpretation of a passage from Pliny the Elder's Natural History, which mentions a \"Caesar\" (one of the ancestors of Julius Caesar) being cut from his mother's womb", "[24] This practice is probably much older than Julius Caesar, and \"C-sections\", as performed by the Romans, were done to rescue the baby from a dying or already dead mother, and were performed post-mortem", "[25] The fact that Julius Caesar's mother Aurelia Cotta lived for decades after Caesar's birth makes this etymology highly unlikely", "[26] Pliny mentions another more widely accepted possibility for the etymology of the word \u201ccaesarian\u201d, claiming that it derives from the Latin word caedere, meaning \u201cto cut\u201d", "Evidence suggests that Jews in ancient Rome successfully practiced C-sections on living mothers who were not in danger of dying", "[27] Evidence of these procedures is found in several collections of ancient Roman rabbis, the most famous of which is called the Mishnah", "[27] Greeks and Egyptians did not perform C-sections, either post-mortem or on living mothers", "However, Greeks would have had at least some knowledge of the Caesarian operation and the procedure involved", "The Greek god Aesclepius was fabled to have been extracted from his mother's womb through this procedure", "Other than the evidence of Jews practicing C-sections in antiquity (very little in ancient Rome, even less in ancient Greece), not much more evidence exists regarding Caesarian-operation birth", "One reason could have been that C-sections were not performed very often because of medical complications or superstitions surrounding C-sections", "In early Christian Rome, C-sections were almost non-existent", "[27] Loss of skill is a possibility for the lack of C-sections", "Infant mortality rates were high in antiquity, so C-sections certainly could have been useful", "However, early Christian doctors could have disregarded C-sections as a socially acceptable operation because of religious beliefs", "Disease, a perceived need for secrecy, and social discouragement could have also been factors that lead to the decline in C-sections among early Christians in Rome", "Almost no evidence exists for C-sections in the Christian world until the 10th century", "The lack of education for women and the social norm that women remained in the private sphere of life (as opposed to public) is theorized to also have contributed to a shortage of C-sections", "[25] Midwives were the primary persons involved in the childbirth process", "They did not record their medical practices in writing like Soranus or Galen", "Thus, C-sections could have potentially occurred on a fairly regular basis, and accounts were simply not recorded", "Mortality was quite high in antiquity due to a few factors: a lack of sanitation and hygienic awareness, no understanding of micro-organisms, and a dearth of effective drugs", "In the context of childbirth, however, maternal and infant mortality were exponentially raised compared to modern standards", "This resulted from the toll childbirth took on women, and the increased risk of infection following labor", "Maternal mortality figures are available only through comparison", "Maternal mortality is thought to be comparable with figures for similar, but much later, societies with more surviving records, such as eighteenth-century rural England, where maternal mortality averaged 25 per 1000 births", "The question of infant mortality in antiquity is complicated by infanticide and exposure, neither of which reflect on medical ability during the period", "The former does this through intentional death of the child, and the latter through abandonment, and possible death", "These reflect instead on social conditions and norms", "While valuable, this is not the information sought, and scholars having painstakingly attempted to eliminate the 'noise' from their inquiries", "Much like maternal mortality, it is difficult to construct actual figures of the infant mortality rate in antiquity, but comparisons have been made between ancient societies and modern non-industrialized societies", "The figures suggest that they are comparable with those of modern industrialized societies to put them in perspective", "While infant mortality is less than 10 per 1000 in modern industrialized societies, non-industrialized societies display rates from 50 to 200+ per 1000", "Scholarship using model life tables and assuming life expectancy at birth of 25 years produces the figure of 300 per 1000 for Roman society", "The history of birth control, also known as contraception and fertility control, refers to the methods or devices that have been historically used to prevent pregnancy", "[1] Planning and provision of birth control is called family planning", "[2] In some times and cultures, abortion had none of the stigma which it has today, making birth control less important", "Birth control and abortion are well documented in Ancient Egypt", "The Ebers Papyrus from 1550\u00a0BC and the Kahun Papyrus from 1850\u00a0BC have within them some of the earliest documented descriptions of birth control, the use of honey, acacia leaves and lint to be placed in the vagina to block sperm", "[5][6] Another early document explicitly referring to birth control methods is the Kahun Gynecological Papyrus from about 1850 BC", "It describes various contraceptive pessaries, including acacia gum, which recent research has confirmed to have spermatocidal qualities and is still used in contraceptive jellies", "Other birth control methods mentioned in the papyrus include the application of gummy substances to cover the \"mouth of the womb\" (i", "the cervix), a mixture of honey and sodium carbonate applied to the inside of the vagina, and a pessary made from crocodile dung", "Lactation (breast-feeding) of up to three years was also used for birth control purposes in ancient Egypt", "The Book of Genesis references withdrawal, or coitus interruptus, as a method of contraception when Onan \"spills his seed\" (ejaculates) on the ground so as to not father a child with his deceased brother's wife Tamar", "Silphium, a species of giant fennel native to north Africa, may have been used as an oral contraceptive in ancient Greece and the ancient Near East", "[7][8] The plant only grew on a small strip of land near the coastal city of Cyrene (located in modern-day Libya)[7][8] and all attempts to cultivate it elsewhere resulted in failure", "[7][8] Silphium was primarily used for culinary purposes and its use as a contraceptive is far less documented than its use as a seasoning", "[8] Accounts of silphium's contraceptive effectiveness are probably greatly exaggerated", "[8] Possibly due to its supposed effectiveness and thus desirability, by the first century AD, it had become so rare that it was worth more than its weight in silver and, by late antiquity, it was fully extinct", "[7] Asafoetida, a close relative of siliphion, was also used for its contraceptive properties", "Other plants commonly used for birth control in ancient Greece include Queen Anne's lace (Daucus carota), willow, date palm, pomegranate, pennyroyal, artemisia, myrrh, and rue", "Some of these plants are toxic and ancient Greek documents specify safe dosages", "Recent studies have confirmed the birth control properties of many of these plants, confirming for example that Queen Anne's lace has post coital anti-fertility properties", "Queen Anne's lace is still used today for birth control in India", "According to Norman E", "Himes, most methods of birth control used in antiquity were probably ineffective", "[9] The single most effective method of birth control known in antiquity was probably coitus interruptus", "[9] The ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle (c", "384\u2013322 BC) recommended applying cedar oil to the womb before intercourse", "[9] Aristotle had no knowledge of how conception worked and he probably recommended this believing that the oil's smoothness would prevent conception", "[9] In actuality, this method may have sometimes been effective because the oil may have gummed up the external os and thereby reduced the motility of the sperm,[9] but effectiveness would have been only occasional and highly variable", "[9] A Hippocratic text On the Nature of Women recommended that a woman who did not desire to conceive a child should drink a copper salt dissolved in water, which it claimed would prevent pregnancy for a year", "[9] This method is not only ineffective, but also dangerous, as the later medical writer Soranus of Ephesus (c", "98\u2013138 AD) pointed out", "[9] Soranus attempted to list reliable methods of birth control", "[9] He took a rational approach to this, rejecting the use of superstition and amulets and instead prescribing common-sense mechanical methods such as vaginal plugs and pessaries using wool as a base covered in oils or other gummy substances", "[9] According to Himes, many of Soranus's methods were probably also ineffective", "In the 7th century BC, the Chinese physician Master Tung-hsuan documented both coitus reservatus and coitus obstructus, which prevents the release of semen during intercourse", "However, it is not known if these methods were used primarily as birth control methods or to preserve the man's yang", "In the medieval Tang Dynasty, Sun Simiao documented the \"thousand of gold contraceptive prescription\" for women who no longer want to bear children", "This prescription, which was supposed to induce sterility, was made of oil and quicksilver heated together for one day and taken orally", "In India, Vatsyayana's classical text (2nd century AD) presented various contraceptive methods including coitus obstructus involving controlling the release of semen", "In the late 9th to early 10th century, the Persian physician Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi documented coitus interruptus, preventing ejaculation and the use of pessaries to block the cervix as birth control methods", "He described a number of pessaries, including elephant dung, cabbages and pitch, used alone or in combination", "[11] During the same period Ali ibn Abbas al-Majusi (Persian) documented the use of pessaries made of rock salt for women for whom pregnancy may be dangerous", "In the early 10th century the Persian Polymath Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina (Persian), known in Europe as Avicenna, included a chapter on birth control in his medical encyclopedia The Canon of Medicine, listing 20 different methods of preventing conception", "[10] However, at least in the hadith Sahih Bukhari 34:432, the prophet Muhammad did not approve of preventative measures", "Indians used a variety of birth control methods since ancient times, including a potion made of powdered palm leaf and red chalk, as well as pessaries made of honey, ghee, rock salt or the seeds of the palasa tree", "A variety of birth control prescriptions, mainly made up of herbs and other plants, are listed in the 12th century Ratirahasya (\"Secrets of Love\") and in the 15th century Ananga Ranga (\"The Stage of the God of Love\")", "In medieval western Europe, any efforts to halt or prevent pregnancy were deemed immoral by the Catholic Church", "[5] Women of the time still used a number of birth control measures such as coitus interruptus, inserting lily root and rue into the vagina, and infanticide after birth", "Historian John M", "Riddle has advanced the hypothesis that women in classical antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Early Modern period used herbs to control fertility", "[14][15] Historian Etienne van de Walle has quoted Riddle as stating that \"most women\" in the Middle Ages knew that certain herbs and herbal products could be taken to induce an abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and that this knowledge was primarily shared amongst women, thus affording them \"more control over their lives than we thought possible\"", "[16][17]  Riddle has further hypothesized that \"these drugs were perfected over centuries in a female culture of which males\u2014who were doing the writing\u2014had only a partial and imperfect understanding\"[17] and it is this shared folk wisdom amongst women that explains the relatively static population size in the West before the 18th century, rather than the high rate of infant mortality", "[15]  Several historians have taken issue with this hypothesis: Gary Ferngren has noted the circumstantial nature of Riddle's evidence and concluded that the ideas remained \"unproved and unlikely,\"[18] while Helen King has written that Riddle makes claims about modern pharmacology that are not supported by his source materials", "[19] Demographer Gigi Santow also takes issue with the proposition, writing that it overemphasizes the role of herbs and stating that Riddle seeks \"not so much to persuade as to convert", "On December 5, 1484, Pope Innocent VIII issued the Summis desiderantes affectibus, a papal bull in which he recognized the existence of witches and gave full papal approval for the Inquisition to proceed \"correcting, imprisoning, punishing and chastising\" witches \"according to their deserts\"", "In the bull, which is sometimes referred to as the \"Witch-Bull of 1484\", the witches were explicitly accused of having \"slain infants yet in the mother's womb\" (abortion) and of \"hindering men from performing the sexual act and women from conceiving\" (contraception)", "[21] Famous texts that served to guide the witch hunt and instruct magistrates on how to find and convict so-called \"witches\" include the Malleus Maleficarum, and Jean Bodin's De la Demonomanie des Sorciers", "[22] The Malleus Maleficarum was written by the priest J", "Sprenger (born in Rheinfelden, today Switzerland), who was appointed by Pope Innocent VIII as the General Inquisitor for Germany around 1475, and H", "Institoris, who at the time was inquisitor for Tyrol, Salzburg, Bohemia and Moravia", "The authors accused witches, among other things, of infanticide and having the power to steal men's penises", "Barrier methods such as the condom have been around much longer, but were seen primarily as a means of preventing sexually transmitted diseases, not pregnancy", "Casanova in the 18th century was one of the first reported using \"assurance caps\" to prevent impregnating his mistresses", "[24][25][26] In 1909, Richard Richter developed the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gr\u00e4fenberg in the late 1920s", "Birth control became a contested political issue in Britain during the 19th century", "Thomas Malthus, an Anglican clergyman, statistician, and economist, argued in An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) that population growth generally expanded exponentially in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population quickly outstripped resources of subsistence", "According to him, there were two types of checks that served to hold population within resource limits: positive checks, which raise the death rate; and preventive ones, which lower the birth rate", "The positive checks include hunger, disease and war; the preventive checks, abortion, birth control, prostitution, postponement of marriage and celibacy", "[28] As a clergyman Malthus condemned birth control as \"morally indefensible along with infanticide, abortion, and adultery", "Malthus later elaborated his contention that human misery (e", ", hunger, disease, and war) was the principal limitation on population growth and would inevitably afflict society along with volatile boom-and-bust economic cycles", "He suggested that paradoxically, efforts to alleviate poverty, such as workhouses, were futile and misguided since they would ultimately only result in subsequent growth in population", "Instead Malthus recommended the preventive checks of sexual continence (chastity) and later marriages, which would produce both higher standards of living and greater economic stability without violating Christian morality", "Malthus's ideas came to carry great weight in British political debate in the 19th century, and they heavily influenced the movement toward the adoption of laissez-faire liberal capitalism", "Malthusians were in favour of limiting population growth and began actively promoting birth control through a variety of groups", "The term 'voluntary motherhood' was coined by feminists in the 1870s as a political critique of \"involuntary motherhood\" and as expressing a desire for women's emancipation", "[31][32] Advocates for voluntary motherhood disapproved of contraception, arguing that women should only engage in sex for the purpose of procreation and advocated periodic or permanent abstinence", "In contrast, the birth control movement advocated for contraception so as to permit sexual intercourse as desired without the risk of pregnancy", "[34] By emphasising \"control\", the birth control movement argued that women should have control over their reproduction - the movement was closely tied to the emerging feminist movement", "The Malthusian League was established in 1877 and promoted the education of the public about the importance of family planning and advocated for the elimination of penalties against the promoters of birth control", "[35] It was initially founded during the \"Knowlton trial\" of Annie Besant and Charles Bradlaugh in July 1877", "[36] They were prosecuted for publishing Charles Knowlton's Fruits of Philosophy which explained various methods of birth control", "[37] Besant and Bradlaugh wrote that it was \"", "more moral to prevent the conception of children, than, after they are born, to murder

up with Wise Parenthood: a Book for Married People, a manual on birth control, published later that year", "[49] She originally tried to publicize her message through the dissemination of pamphlets in the slums of East London, but this approach failed to work, as the working class was too mistrustful of well-intentioned meddlers at the time", "In 1921, after years of planning, Stopes and her husband Humphrey Verdon Roe opened the Mothers' Clinic in Holloway, North London", "[51] The clinic, run by midwives and supported by visiting doctors,[52] offered mothers birth control advice and

contraception acceptable during the 1920s by framing it in scientific terms and gained an international reputation", "The Malthusian League opened up a second clinic shortly afterward, but admitted that Stopes clinic had been the first in the British Empire, although the League emphasised that theirs was the first scientific clinic where birth control instruction was given under medical supervision (the medical officer was Norman Haire)", "[53] These two clinics 'opened up a new period in the history of the movement aimed at the emancipation of women from their slavery to the

conception", "The bill's passing resulted in large-scale celebrations by abortion rights activists who had long campaigned for it", "[82] The Argentine Senate approved the bill 38\u201329 on December 29, and it is expected to be signed by President Alberto Fernandez", "Argentina will become the fourth Latin American country to legalize abortion", "Because of the ongoing discrimination that women face around the world, many organizations have come together and will come together to work and make efforts to equalize the rights and respect for women", "Women's Autonomic, Equality and Reproductive Health and International Human Rights: Between Recognition, Backlash and Regressive Trends is a group that makes efforts towards the discrimination against women in law", "This organization represents and advocates the rights of women to equality, dignity, and respect for her private life without discrimination", "They have certain beliefs and outlooks towards humanitarian rights regarding termination of pregnancy at any time during the full pregnancy, and make aware that they believe the right of pregnant women to access termination of pregnancy should be autonomous affordable and effective", "The fight for women's right, especially regarding her choice to abortion, has been an ongoing event with many negotiations, arguments, and exception", "Overtime, many political figures have tried to contribute to the best of their ability to equalize women's rights, which surfaces the main discriminators of all women who seek out abortion", "It is not limited to the political figures, but the women's peers, authorities, family, friends, coworkers, etc", "Discrimination is not limited to law, and as this becomes more apparent, it is the goal of this movement, the Abortion Rights Movement, to allow women to choose discreetly what is best fitting for their lifestyle and their needs", "Anti-abortion movements, also self-styled as pro-life or abolitionist movements,[1] are involved in the abortion debate advocating against the practice of abortion and its legality", "Many anti-abortion movements began as countermovements in response to the legalization of elective abortions", "Abortion is the ending of a pregnancy by removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus", "In Europe, abortion law varies by country, and has been legalized through parliamentary acts in some countries, and constitutionally banned or heavily restricted in others", "In Western Europe this has had the effect at once of both more closely regulating the use of abortion, and at the same time mediating and reducing the impact anti-abortion campaigns have had on the law", "The first specifically anti-abortion organization in France, Laissez-les-vivre-SOS futures m\u00e8res, was created in 1971 during the debate that was to lead to the Veil Law in 1975", "Its main spokesman was the geneticist J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lejeune", "Since 2005, the French anti-abortion movement has organized an annual March for Life", "The 1920 abortion laws of France have not been entirely repealed leading to ambiguity in the nation's policies", "[4] By 1975, Simone Veil, the minister for health, introduced legislation that specifically in cases of distress \"tolerated\" abortion up to ten weeks", "[5] Abortions after this date are only cleared by the government if the pregnancy endangers the health of the woman or will result in the birth of a child with a severe and incurable disease", "[5] After twelve weeks, abortion, except for \"therapeutic abortion, under the terms of Article 317 of the Criminal Code, is a crime, punishable by 6 months to 10 years in prison, a fine of between 1800 and 250,000 Francs, and loss of professional license", "Catholics and right-wing

anti-abortion groups in the Republic of Ireland, including Pro Life Campaign, Youth Defence and the Iona Institute", "The Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (2018) provided for legal abortion in Ireland, but several anti-abortion parties still campaign, including Aont\u00fa and the National Party (Ireland, 2016)", "In Liechtenstein, an application to legalize abortions was rejected by a slim majority in a referendum in 2011", "The opponents, which included Prince Alois, got 500 votes more and eventually settled at 52", "3 percent compared with 47", "Prince Alois had announced the use of his veto in advance if necessary to prevent the introduction of abortion", "Abortion is legal in Russia as an elective procedure up to the 12th week of pregnancy, and in special circumstances at later stages", "[10] The abortion issue gained renewed attention in 2011 in a debate that The New York Times says \"has begun to sound like the debate in the United States\"", "[11] Parliament passed and President Dmitri Medvedev signed several restrictions on abortion into law to combat \"a falling birthrate\" and \"plunging population\"", "[11] The restrictions include requiring abortion providers to devote 10% of advertising costs to describing the dangers of abortion to a woman's health and make it illegal to describe abortion as a safe medical procedure", "Medvedev's wife Svetlana Medvedeva has taken up the anti-abortion cause in Russia in a weeklong national campaign against abortion called \"Give Me Life!\" and a \"Day of Family, Love and

October 2009 to protest plans by the government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Zapatero to legalize elective abortions and eliminate parental consent restrictions", "In the United Kingdom, the most prominent anti-abortion organization is the Society for the Protection of Unborn Children", "It was formed at the time of the passage of the 1967 Abortion Act which liberalized abortion law", "The group campaigns against abortion, often using questionable claims,[13] and supports protests at pregnancy clinics", "[14] The Abortion Act of 1967 had a significant effect in Britain (excluding Northern Ireland)", "The Act states that if at least two doctors deem the reasons for abortion to be in alignment with the Act, it can legally be performed", "This still means that the punishment for women who obtain abortions contrary to the Act are faced with potential life imprisonment", "Doctors too can be prosecuted if they are found administering abortions without reasonable cause", "[15] The Abortion Act of 1967 did not apply in Northern Ireland", "Women living there who sought abortions either had to travel to Britain to receive an abortion or potentially face criminal charges for purchasing abortion pills illegally", "To this day, anti-abortion activists routinely stand outside many abortion clinics; their goal is to discourage women from entering the clinics", "This is through two processes, known as \"prayer vigils\", which are sometimes quiet and other times said aloud to actively dissuade; and \"pavement counseling\", where activists approach women entering clinics in order to persuade them to continue with their pregnancies", "This is a practice held in low regard by many, as it causes anxiety and distress", "In Israel, the major anti-abortion organization is Efrat", "[16] Efrat activists primarily raise funds to relieve the \"financial and social pressures\" on pregnant women so that they will not terminate their pregnancies", "However, this activity is only carried out in the Jewish sector in Israeli society, as Efrat officially views abortion among Jews as a demographic threat to the Jewish people", "The United States anti-abortion movement formed as a response to the landmark 1973 Roe v", "Wade  and Doe v", "Bolton Supreme Court decisions, with many anti-abortion organizations having emerged since then", "There is also a smaller consistent life ethic movement, favoring a philosophy which opposes all forms of killing, including abortion, war, euthanasia, and capital punishment", "The current movement is in part a continuation of previous debates on abortion that led to the practice being banned in all states in the late 19th century", "The initial movement was led by physicians, but also included politicians and feminists", "Among physicians, advances in medical knowledge played a significant role in influencing anti-abortion opinion", "Quickening, which had previously been thought to be the point at which the soul entered a human was discovered to be a relatively unimportant step in fetal development, caused many medical professionals to rethink their positions on early term abortions", "[18] Ideologically, the Hippocratic Oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion", "Meanwhile, many 19th-century feminists tended to regard abortion as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men", "[19] The \"free love\" wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women", "[20] Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women's right to abstinence", "Evangelical organizations like Focus on the Family are involved in anti-abortion movements", "A Conservative MP, Cathay Wagantall, introduced a bill in 2020 seeking to ban abortions for the purpose of choosing a child's sex", "[22] Abortion in Canada is legal at all stages of pregnancy and funded in part by the Canada Health Act", "[23] In 2013, the Conservative prime minister, Stephen Harper, barred the members of Parliament from discussing the matter in the Commons", "Harper's move was linked to his repeated declarations that he wouldn't allow the abortion debate to be re-opened", "[22] Since the 1980s, at least forty-three private member bills that are against abortion have been sent to the House of Commons yet none of them have been passed", "[4] Canadian anti-abortion discourse increasingly \"aims at changing cultural values more than legislation; is explicitly framed as 'pro-woman'; largely avoids appealing to religious grounds; and relies on a new 'abortion-harms-women' argument that has supplanted and transformed traditional fetal personhood arguments\"", "Since 1998, Catholics and allies have held national anti-abortion March for Life rallies at Parliament Hill", "[24][25] Two have gathered over 10,000 protesters", "In addition to the national protests, anti-abortionists protest abortion clinics across the nation in attempts to stop abortions from continuing", "A number of anti-abortion organizations exist in Australia, including Cherish Life, Right to Life Australia, and Australian Christian Lobby", "These organizations undertake various campaigning activities, including political campaign fundraising", "A large portion of Australian law surrounding abortion was originally derived from the British law", "[27] Until 1967, British law stated that \"an induced abortion is unlawful in all situations save the (probable) exception of situations where it is necessary to save the life of the mother", "\"[28] Australia partook of this law until Britain changed it in 1967 towards a more liberal standpoint", "All states and territories, except Western Australia, have laws prohibiting anti-abortion campaigners from harassing visitors and staff of abortion clinics by setting exclusion zones around abortion clinics", "The right to life is the belief that a being has the right to live and, in particular, should not be killed by another entity", "The concept of a right to life arises in debates on issues including capital punishment, with some people seeing it as immoral; abortion, where some feel an unborn fetus is alive and should not be ended prematurely; euthanasia, where the decision to end one's life outside of natural means is seen as incorrect; and in killings by law enforcement, which is seen by some as an infringement of a person's right to live", "Various individuals may disagree in which of these areas the principle of a right to life might apply", "The term \"right to life\" is used in the abortion debate by those who wish to end the practice of abortion, or at least reduce the frequency of the practice,[1] and in the context of pregnancy, the term right to life was advanced by Pope Pius XII during a 1951 papal encyclical:", "Every human being, even the child in the womb, has the right to life directly from God and not from his parents, not from any society or human authority", "Therefore, there is no man, no society, no human authority, no science, no \u201cindication\u201d at all whether it be medical, eugenic, social, economic, or moral that may offer or give a valid judicial title for a direct deliberate disposal of an innocent human life", "In 1966 the National Conference of Catholic Bishops (NCCB) asked Fr", "McHugh to begin observing trends in abortion reform within the United States", "[3] The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) was founded in 1967 as the Right to Life League to coordinate its state campaigns under the auspices of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops", "[4][5] To appeal to a more broad-based, nonsectarian movement, key Minnesota leaders proposed an organizational model that would separate the NRLC from the direct oversight of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and by early 1973 NRLC Director Fr", "McHugh and his executive assistant, Michael Taylor, proposed a different plan, facilitating the NRLC move toward its independence from the Roman Catholic Church", "Some utilitarian ethicists argue that the \"right to life\", where it exists, depends on conditions other than membership of the human species", "The philosopher Peter Singer is a notable proponent of this argument", "For Singer, the right to life is grounded in the ability to plan and anticipate one's future", "This extends the concept to non-human animals, such as other apes, but since the unborn, infants and severely disabled people lack this, he states that abortion, painless infanticide and euthanasia can be \"justified\" (but are not obligatory) in certain special circumstances, for instance in the case of a disabled infant whose life would be one of suffering", "Bioethicists associated with disability rights and disability studies communities have argued that Singer's epistemology is based on ableist conceptions of disability", "Opponents of capital punishment argue that it is a violation of the right to life, while its supporters argue that the death penalty is not a violation of the right to life because the right to life should apply with deference to a sense of justice", "The opponents believe that capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture", "Human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it \"cruel, inhuman, and degrading punishment\", and Amnesty International considers it to be \"the ultimate, irreversible denial of Human Rights\"", "The United Nations General Assembly has adopted, in 2007, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016[9] non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition", "The International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement[11] has created a system whereby it is recognised that international human rights law is binding upon all state actors, and that said state actors must know and be capable of applying international standards for human rights", "The right to life is for the most part an inalienable right granted to every human upon the planet, however, there are certain situations in which state actors are required to take drastic action, which can result in civilians being killed by law enforcement agents", "Appropriate occasions for killings by law enforcement are strictly outlined by the International Human Rights Standards for Law Enforcement", "Any lethal action taken by law enforcement agents must be taken following a certain set of rules that have been set out in the 'Use of Force' section of the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police", "[11] The essential tenet of the Pocket Book[11] surrounding the use of lethal force is that all other means of a non-violent nature should be employed initially, followed by proportionately appropriate use of force", "Proportionately appropriate use of force can, and will in some circumstances, refer to lethal force if a law enforcement agent genuinely believes that ending the life of one civilian would result in the preservation of his life, or the lives of his fellow civilians, as is outlined in the 'Permissible Circumstances for the Use of Firearms' section of the Pocket Book", "[11] The Pocket Book[11] also outlines in the 'Accountability for the Use of Force and Firearms' section that there are stringent measures of accountability in place to maintain integrity within state law enforcement agencies as regards their right to the use of lethal force", "International institutions have outlined when and where law enforcement agents might have the availability of lethal force at their disposal", "The International Association of Chiefs of Police have 'Model Policies' which incorporate various pieces of information from leading sources", "[12] One of these model policies states that law enforcement agents will engage in reasonable necessary force to efficiently bring a scenario to a conclusion, giving specific thought to both the safety of themselves and other civilians", "Law enforcement officers are given the prerogative to engage in department-approved methods to safely bring a conclusion to a scenario and are also given the ability to use issued equipment to resolve issues in scenarios where they are required to protect themselves or others from damage, to bring resistant individuals under control, or to safely conclude unlawful incidents", "There is no mention as to what \"reasonably necessary\" should be interpreted as meaning, but there is reference made to the reasonable man method of determining how one should approach a scenario", "[13] However, it has been highlighted through events such as the killing of Michael Brown by Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri,[14] which resulted in public unrest, that there is confusion and debate surrounding the use of firearms and lethal force", "The 'Procedure for the Use of Firearms' section provides the process through which law enforcement agents must progress when using firearms", "It states that they must identify themselves as a law enforcement agent, issue a clear warning, and give an adequate amount of time for response (providing that time would not likely result in harm being done to the agent or other civilians) before deadly force can be used within the bounds of international law", "While the Pocket Book on Human Rights for the Police outlines the academic circumstances under which law enforcement agents may use lethal force, the literal scenarios in which police killings have occurred are also relevant", "Rosenfeld[15] states that there is considerable literature that gives reason to believe that social conditions also have a part to play in how law enforcement killings can occur", "Rosenfeld states that there are numerous studies that have been conducted which link law enforcement agents' use of lethal force to the area's rate of violent crime, the size of the non-indigenous population and the socioeconomic position of the community concerned", "[16] Appropriating a blanket description of how police killings can occur across the board is difficult given the vast differences in social context from state to state", "Perry, Hall and Hall[17] discuss the phenomena across the United States of America which became highly charged and widely documented in late 2014, referring to the use of lethal force from white police officers on unarmed black male civilians", "[18] There is no legal prerogative which gives law enforcement agents the ability to use lethal force based on the race of the person they are dealing with, there is only a legal prerogative to engage in lethal force if there is a reasonable fear for your life or the lives of others", "However, the Propublica analysis of federal data on fatal police shootings between 2010 and 2012, showed that young black male civilians were 21 times more likely to be killed by police than young white male civilians", "[19] The use of lethal force from law enforcement agents in the United States created widespread feeling amongst US citizens that they were not being protected by the police", "The justice system mostly found that these agents acted within the boundaries of the law because the actions of the people who were shot were judged to be sufficiently questionable in character for the police officer to fear for their own life or the lives of others", "Coppolo[20] investigated Connecticut law and reported that the use of lethal force must be followed by a report that determines whether the law enforcement agent's lethal force was proportionately necessary in the circumstances", "Coppolo also stated that a reasonable lethal response must only be made when there is a reasonable belief that the facts you have been presented with could realistically result in a risk of death or grievous bodily harm", "Those who believe a person should be able to make the decision to end their own life through euthanasia use the argument that persons have a right to choose ,[22] while those who oppose the legalization of euthanasia argue so on the grounds that all persons have a right to life", "They are commonly referred to as right-to-lifers", "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person", "Every human being has the inherent right to life", "This right shall be protected by law", "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life", "Every person has the right to have his life respected", "This right shall be protected by law and, in general, from the moment of conception", "No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his life", "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"]}
